\title{Create Graded Emails for Students}
\usage{
createGradedEmail(s, g, subjectLine = "Graded genetics exam")
}
\arguments{
\item{s}{A list of student objects, each containing detailed information including the student's email and the filename of the solution document to be attached.}

\item{g}{A list of grades corresponding to each student, intended to match the student list one-to-one.}

\item{subjectLine}{A character string to be used as the subject line of the emails, defaulting to "Graded genetics exam".}
}
\value{
This function does not return a value but executes an action to prepare emails for sending. Each email is composed with a subject line, body text based on student feedback, and an attachment containing the student's graded exam solutions.
}
\description{
This function prepares and potentially sends graded emails to students based on their exam submissions. It uses feedback generated for each student, attaches relevant files, and sets a subject line for the email.
}
\details{
The function leverages the `gmailr` package for email composition and attachment handling. Before using this function, ensure that the `gmailr` setup has been completed and the necessary authentication is in place to interact with Google's email services.
}
\note{
This function assumes that `createGradeFeedback` has been defined and is available for generating the body text of the emails. The actual sending of emails may require additional steps or function calls according to the `gmailr` package documentation.
}
\examples{
# Assuming 'students' is a list of student objects with email and solutions file name,
# and 'grades' is a list of corresponding grades for those students:
createGradedEmail(students, grades)
}
